# guess my number Project

Game that consists of guessing a hidden secret number between 1 and 20. The user begins with an initial score of 20 that will decrease by 1 point with each attempt, so it only has 20 opportunities to try. Once the user guesses the secret number, wins the game, but if the score counter reaches 0 it loses. The user also has a highscore to improve by trying to play more times.

The language learned in this course's project was JavaScript.

This project was built by me, based on the online course The Complete JavaScript Course by professor Jonas Schmedtmann, who designed it and allowed me to use it for my personal learning and portfolio.
